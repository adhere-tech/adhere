# AdHere

AdHere is an automated framework that assesses compliance with the Better Ads Standards and
helps website developers to detect and fix the violations.
AdHere can pinpoint ads on the fly and identify participating ad networks. 
It can also provide fix suggestions for developers and 
assist developers in improving their fix solutions while preserving more ad revenue.

This repository contains the source code of AdHere, 
the script used for the preliminary study, and the dataset.
The Preliminary Study Toolset is used to get the compliance status from Google Ad Experience Report.

## Dependencies
- Python 3 (recommended >= 3.7)  
- Python 3 libraries: Selenium, lxml, wmi, pywin32, requests
- Google Chrome (recommended version >= 79) 
- [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/): Version corresponding to Chrome version and OS

## Setup Instructions

### Virtual machine (VM)
We provide a virtual machine with AdHere and the preliminary study toolset installed and ready to use. 

#### Import VM
- Have a virtual machine manager installed. Free [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) Recommended (version >= 6.1). The following section will use VirtualBox as an example.
- Download the packed virtual machine [here](https://osf.io/s8mhw/?view_only=42a1f52903964e68836faa76f84a180f) named 'adhere-vm.zip', 'adhere-vm.z01' to 'adhere-vm.z04' (5 files in total) and unzip it. The unzipped file should be 'adhere-vm.ova'.
- Toolbar: File -> Import Appliance. Keep Source as 'Local File System' and choose the VM file you just downloaded, then click Next. If you have a very limited CPU and/or RAM (not recommended), adjust the number of CPU and memory allocated. Change the base folder and Machine Base Folder, and they can be the same folder on a disk with more than 15 GB of free space. Click Import. It may take minutes to import so please wait for the progress to complete.

#### Execute AdHere in VM
- Choose the imported VM on VirtualBox's interface and click Start (green arrow). It should log in automatically and show the desktop.
- The username and password: adhere
- To run AdHere: Right-click on desktop -> Open in Terminal, type ```./adhere.sh```. AdHere will detect ads on Google.com. Once finished, you can find the result file in ~/adhere-linux/. If you want to detect another website, modify line 3 in adhere.sh and replace google.com with the domain. Please pay attention that the detection on a big website may take 5-20 minutes.
- To run the preliminary toolset: Right-click on desktop -> Open in Terminal, type ```./google.sh```. It will detect the top 10 websites' status. Once finished, you can the result file in ~/adhere-linux/[R] XX.csv.

#### Notes for reuse
- In order to make the google.py ready to use, we provide our own API key. However, it has a very limited quota. Please change it to your own API key(s) and change line 16's value to 'top-1m.csv' if you want to try large-scale work.
- We have disabled the automatic update of Google Chrome in VM but it is still possible that Chrome will be updated, sometimes accidentally. If you find that the version of Chrome is not 79, please uninstall it and install Google Chrome version 79 or change the chromedriver based on Chrome's current version.

### From source code
Please first download 
the source code [here (osf.io, recommended)](https://osf.io/s8mhw/?view_only=42a1f52903964e68836faa76f84a180f) named 'adhere-adtifact.zip' or [here](https://github.com/adhere-tech/adhere-tech.github.io/tree/master/SourceCode).
#### AdHere
1. Install Python 3 and all dependencies.
2. Based on the OS and Chrome version, 
   download the corresponding version of Chromedriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). 
   Unzip the downloaded file and put `chromedriver.exe` in the same folder as `AdHere.py`.
3. Fill Google Chrome's user profile directory after `USRPROFILE = ` in `AdHere.py`.
4. Run `python AdHere.py domain_url` in the command line to run AdHere on the given URL. 
   Leaving `domain_url` blank will perform a self-inspection on google.com. 
   It will scan the website with the headless (no GUI) Google Chrome. After finishing the scan, 
   AdHere will generate `violations.txt` in the same folder as `AdHere.py`. 
   The text file contains violations (i.e., the id, violation type, and XPath) and their fix suggestions.
    
#### Preliminary Study Toolset
1. Install Python 3 and all [dependencies](adhere-tech.github.io#dependencies).
2. Create at least one project using Google Ad Experience Report API in Google Developer Console. 
   Apply for the API key for each project.
3. Fill API key(s) in `API_KEY_LIST` in `google.py`. 
   Adjust `THREAD_COUNT` based on the comments in `google.py`.
4. Run `python google.py` in the terminal to get Google Ad Experience Report's result on the Alexa Top 1 Million Websites. 
   Try to keep the network connection stable.
5. In the generated files,`[R]Alexa_done [XX_XX].csv` is the raw file to be stored in the database. 
   It records the compliance status of the 1 million websites.


## Dataset

## Findings

#### Finding 1. Website Coverage
![Unable to display figure1. Check browser settings.](figs/data_8.png)

Among the websites being reviewed by Google, the average
number of mobile websites that failed daily is 884 while the desktop
version is 690. Moreover, the average number of websites passed
daily is 53,353 for mobile and 61,025 for desktop. The above figure shows the
number of sites with the PASSING status and FAILING status from
April 13, 2019, to August 18, 2019.
In general, among those that have been reviewed, we observed a
consistent trend that mobile websites contain more violating
ads than the desktop version. However, the number of violating
sites for both platforms is declining.

#### Finding 2. Ad Networks
![Unable to display table1. Check browser settings.](figs/table_4.png)

The above table shows ad network statistics from ads collected
from AdHere-detected violating websites (on August 19th, 2020).
As can be seen, ExoClick, Google Ads, and JUICYADS were the
most prominent ad networks that presented the tendency to deliver violating
ads. Note that these top networks delivering violating
ads are not necessarily popular networks. According to the statistics
provided by W3Techs, 71.4% (15 out of 21) of these networks
are unranked and have a market share of much less than 0.1%.

#### Finding 3. Fix with Attribute Modification - A Case Study

The fix example happens on the mobile website "getsongbpm.com", 
a website telling the bpm (beats per minute) of songs. 
The following figure shows how a violating ad was fixed.
The screenshot on the left shows the web page before the fix 
and the screenshot on the right shows the page after the fix. 
The red square on the left highlights a Pop-up Ad that blocks interactions with other elements. 
Based on the Better Ads Standards, this Pop-up Ad is violating the standards. 
A non-violating ad was used to fix the violation. 
The green square on the right shows that the Pop-up was replaced by a non-violating ad.

The code snippets of the page before and after the fix are shown below.

Code snippet of Pop-up Ad (line numbers are positions in the source file):
